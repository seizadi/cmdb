spec:
  # Composite resources may optionally expose a connection secret - a Kubernetes
  # Secret containing all of the details a pod might need to connect to the
  # resource. Resources that wish to expose a connection secret must declare
  # what keys they support. These keys form a 'contract' - any composition that
  # intends to be compatible with this resource must compose resources that
  # supply these connection secret keys.
  connectionSecretKeys:
    - username
    - password
    - endpoint
    - port

  # An enforced composition will be selected for all instances of this type and
  # will override any selectors and references.

  # The kind of claim this composite resource offers. Optional - omit the claim
  # names if you don't wish to offer a claim for this composite resource. Must
  # be different from the composite resource's kind. The established convention
  # is for the claim kind to represent what the resource is, conceptually. e.g.
  # 'MySQLInstance', not `MySQLInstanceClaim`.
  claimNames:
    kind: PostgresInstance
    plural: postgresinstances
  # A composite resource may be served at multiple versions simultaneously, but
  # all versions must have identical schemas; Crossplane does not yet support
  # conversion between different version schemas.
  versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    # Served specifies whether this version should be exposed via the API
    # server's REST API.
    served: true
    # Referenceable specifies whether this version may be referenced by a
    # Composition. Exactly one version may be referenceable by Compositions, and
    # that version must be served. The referenceable version will always be the
    # storage version of the underlying CRD.

    # This schema defines the configuration fields that the composite resource
    # supports. It uses the same structural OpenAPI schema as a Kubernetes CRD
    # - for example, this resource supports a spec.parameters.version enum.
    # The following fields are reserved for Crossplane's use, and will be
    # overwritten if included in this validation schema:
    #
    # - spec.resourceRef
    # - spec.resourceRefs
    # - spec.claimRef
    # - spec.writeConnectionSecretToRef
    # - status.conditions
